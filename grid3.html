      <h2>Grid auto Rows:</h2>
      <p>
        The grid-auto-rows CSS property specifies the size of an
        implicitly-created grid row track or pattern of tracks. If a grid item
        is positioned into a row that is not explicitly sized by
        grid-template-rows, implicit grid tracks are created to hold it. This
        can happen either by explicitly positioning into a row that is out of
        range, or by the auto-placement algorithm creating additional rows.
      </p>

      <h2>Grid auto Columns:</h2>
      <p>
        The grid-auto-columns CSS property specifies the size of an
        implicitly-created grid column track or pattern of tracks. If a grid
        item is positioned into a column that is not explicitly sized by
        grid-template-columns, implicit grid tracks are created to hold it. This
        can happen either by explicitly positioning into a column that is out of
        range, or by the auto-placement algorithm creating additional columns.
